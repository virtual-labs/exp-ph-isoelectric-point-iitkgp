## Theory

Amino acids are amphoteric. They are made of both ionizable acidic (α-carboxylic group) and basic
(α-amino group) moieties. Therefore, they can act as acids as well as an alkali depending on the pH of
the media.

Based on the properties of the side chain, the amino acids are classified into various types (Figure
2).

1. Non-polar side-chain – These amino acids do not participate in intermolecular H-bonding with
their side chain (e.g. Alanine).
2. Polar uncharged side-chain – These amino acids have non-ionizable side chains that participate
in intermolecular H-bonding or ionic interactions (e.g. Serine).
3. Charged side-chain – Positively charged NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> (e.g. Lys) or negatively charged COO<sup>-</sup> (e.g. Asp)
side-chains.
At physiological pH, most amino acids exist as zwitterions with both positive and negative
charges. The pH at which the amino acid has equal number of positive and negative charges is
termed as its isoelectric point or pI. At pH values above and and below the pI, the amino acid
bears positive and negative charges respectively (Figure 3).

to a zwitterion and then to a negatively charged moiety as pH increases</p>

The zwitterion is a salt formed as a result of the acid-base reactions of the basic amino group
and acidic carboxylic group. The acid-base reactions are the following:
1. Deprotonation (loss of H<sup>+</sup>) of COOH group as pH increases.
2. Protonation (gain of H<sup>+</sup>) of NH<sub>2</sub> to give NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> as pH decreases.

**How is the isoelectric point of an amino acid determined?**

According to Henderson Hesselbalch equation (Figure 4), the pH equals pK<sub>a</sub> (the quantitative measure of the strength of an acid) when the concentration of the acid (HA) is the same as that of its conjugate base (A<sup>-</sup>). Lower pK<sub>a</sub> values mean a stronger acid. The pK<sub>a</sub> is the pH at the mid-point of the flat buffering zones in a titration plot (pH vs volume of titrant). Table 1 lists out the pK<sub>a</sub> and pI values of each amino acid along with their properties.

To calculate the pI of a neutral amino acid, an average of the pK<sub>a1</sub> and pK<sub>a2</sub> values are taken. However, to find the pI of a triprotic acid, the average of the pK<sub>a</sub> values that are closest to the pH at which the amino acid assumes zero net charge is used (Figure 6).

**How is the isoelectric point of a peptide is determined?**

The isoelectric point of a peptide can be determined in a similar fashion as described above. Let us take the example of a tripeptide Asp-Gly-Glu. The pK<sub>a</sub> values are listed below. As the pH increases from 1 to 10, the tripeptide transitions from net positive to negative charge. At pH above 2.2, net charge is zero. Therefore, the major contributors of the isoelectric point are the pK<sub>a</sub> values closest to pH 2.2 i.e. pK<sub>a</sub> 3.86 and 2.19. Therefore pI is calculated as an average of these 2 pK<sub>a</sub> values.

<!-- pK<sub>a</sub>    2.19  3.86  4.25  9.82   -->

pH | 1 | 2.5 | 4 | 5 | 10| 
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Net Charge| +1 | 0 | -1 | -2 | -3 |  

Since zero net charge lies between pH of 2.19 and 3.86,  
Isoelectric point = (2.19 + 3.86)/2 = 3.03




**What is the biological and physiological significance of the amino acid titration curves?**

Understanding the titration curves of amino acids reaches far and wide within the realm of biology and medicine. The knowledge of pH-dependent charge of the constituent amino acids of a protein allows researchers to predict the folding, stability, and interaction of proteins, and unravel deeper insights into enzyme mechanisms.
  

From a clinical perspective, understanding the impact of pH alternations on proteins can influence diagnostic and treatment strategies. A notable example is the disease metabolic acidosis, where a lower blood pH could potentially affect the structure and function of essential proteins. These studies find applications in nutrition and hereditary diseases as they throw light on why some mutations cause disease and others do not or on developing therapeutic strategies that alter protein interactions.
